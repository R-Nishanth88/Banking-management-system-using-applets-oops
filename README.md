# Banking-management-system-using-applets-oops

 This Java code creates a basic financial system with a graphical user interface (GUI). Users can create two different kinds of accounts using it: current and savings accounts. Users can create an account, use their usernames and passwords to log in, and carry out standard operations including fund transfers between accounts, withdrawals, deposits, and balance checks. However, the system does not have persistent data storage; instead, account information is stored in arrays, which are destroyed when a programme terminates. Security elements and account number generation are also streamlined. Using Java's Swing framework for GUI interaction, the code illustrates fundamental banking functions; however, it requires enhancements for practical use..
